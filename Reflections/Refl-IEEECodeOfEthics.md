| SUBJ | Reflection: IEEE Code of Ethics   |

# IEEE Code of Ethics
IEEE's Code of Ethics acts as a semi-abstract list of guidelines for members to follow in their actions representing IEEE. They seek to define how to act and how to not act with respect to data, individuals, and conflicts. It is also notable that they use precisely the words "ethical and professional conduct" -- they do not attempt to assign some moral value of right/wrongness to their code, only that it is the expected behaviorisms of its member, an important distinction. While IEEE's Code of Ethics is largely in-line with modern-day trends/beliefs and as such does not provide too much in the way of moral/ethical conflicts, it is important yet still for an organization to remove moral assignments, as shown here.

## Teaching and Discussion Paves the Path to Understanding and Acceptance
> 5. to improve the understanding by individuals and society of the capabilities and societal implications of conventional and emerging technologies, including intelligent systems; 

Professor Myers and myself have spent many hours debating the pros and cons of upcoming trends in technology, such as the prevalence of cameras, use of Big Data to target advertisements, GMOs, etc. While our opinions may drastically differ, we do agree unilaterally that there should be more education on these topics in school systems and to the public. It appears to us that people in general are not learning enough about the upcoming changes of organizations and the government in how they view, observe, and interact with people and how this may affect our future, and without the education on these matters, it is dificult for people to make informed, free-thinking, and thought-out decisions outside of what some single person or article told them to think.

As such, we support this guideline full-heartedly, and it is on our roadmap in our newly begun organization S.E.E.D. to put educate people on new technologies and how it may affect their lives as well as spark dialogue on the matter within the campus.

## Know your Limits
> 6. to maintain and improve our technical competence and to undertake technological tasks for others only if qualified by training or experience, or after full disclosure of pertinent limitations;  

I've had a saying that goes like...

> The only thing more dangerous than someone who knows nothing is someone who knows everything.

It's probably on the internet somewhere, and mostly just a rewording of the innumerable anecdotes of the dangers of pretending to know what one does not. However, I use it as a personal guideline -- never let my eagerness to do or overconfidence deceive others and, more importantly, myself. I know some disagree, and I have been told by many that instead you should "fake it till you make it" or "always appear to know what you're doing", however in my limited experiences I have found admitting short-comings and always acting below your skill-level ensures that you can deliver on promises and expectations more reliably and thus be a proficient member of your team or organization.

Now mind you, I am not saying never expand your skillset or only work comfortably in skills you already know -- you would never grow. However, there are ways to do that safely and with humility. Work in the "yellow zone", as they say, on the edge of your skillset, and do not be hesitant to mention when something is out of one's league, such as a complex simultaneous equation, high-paying but experienced engineering job, or obtaining a girlfriend. Approach problem energetically, but also with caution, and be aware of where to go for help. 

In short, this ethical statement resonates strongly with my personal code, as I have witnessed teams crumble due to the pretending of skills people do not have in order to "gain respect" or such.
