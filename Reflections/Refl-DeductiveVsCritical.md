# Deductive vs. Critical Reasoning
Apparently there was some confusion on critical thinking and how it relates to deductive reasoning. As such, I will summarize the two and expound on their differences.

## Critical Thinking
Critical thinking largely relates to the ability to think "outside the box", as they say. It is the *application* of knowledge and relationships in order to form new relationships. It does *not* apply to the retention of knowledge, nor even necessarily logical thought processes. Critical thinking is a creative endeavor to grasp for new ideas and meaning than is readily apparent.

## Deductive Reasoning
Deductive reasoning is the seeking of individual truths and knowledge from general premises. It is a very strong manner of obtaining conclusions in logic, though it is as weak as each of its premises. A common example of deductive reasoning: "Hamburgers are unhealthy. McDouble is a hamburger. McDoubles are thus unhealthy."

Deductive reasoning stands in contrast with and relies on *inductive reasoning*, the seeking of a general truth from specific instances. We think hamburgers are unhealthy or that animals must drink water or the sun will rise each day due to a mixture of inductive and deductive reasoning. First, as children, we saw that everyone drunk water and the sun rose each day, thus we made an inference that these were general truths. Then, mostly subconsciously, we applied these "truths" to predictions in the future: animals for the most part will still need to drink water and tomorrow, as it is a day and all days before have had suns, will follow that trend. 

Deduction is thusly fallible, however, in that those trends may not be true: A company could form a Health-burger, animals could evolve to accept H_2 O_2 instead of water, and the sun one day may fade. The only other major premises we have are axioms -- "inherent" truths that we establish as the groundwork for our beliefs and faith in some principle. Some, for instance, establish the existence of God as an inherent truth from which other truths may be deduced; more commonly and socially acceptable, many also hold various mathematic and logical principles as "truth", such as "A is equal to A" or such. These allow us to use deductive thinking outside of what we see, observe, and induce.

## Critical Thinking in contrast to Deductive Reasoning
They are hardly alike.

When speaking about deductive reasoning, it is largely in contrast with inductive reasoning. This is because these are moreover lines of thought and step-by-step processes at obtaining new knowledge. They do not necessarily require critical thinking, even. Critical thinking refers to the ability to look at several relationships and pieces of knowledge and presume or glean new insights (and potentially wrong ones at that) from them. It is possible that perhaps "under the hood" in the brain it is a result of several subconscious, simultaneous lines of reasoning. These two concepts, however, are not fundamentally linked: deductive reasoning is a way to gain relatively sure knowledge based on premises, critical thinking is a manner of examining and extrapolating various relationships into a new potential idea.
