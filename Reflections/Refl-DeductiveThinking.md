# Deductive Reasoning: Certain Logic with Uncertain Results
Deductive reasoning stands as a very useful daily tool and even when not applied explicitly is used in daily presumptions (not assumptions) and decision-making processes. Deductive reasoning uses general, "known" premises presumed true to create a logical conclusion. A simple example: "Greens and salads are healthy, so the salad from this store is healthy." That can be further extended with "Greasy meats are not healthy, ergo the hamburger from this store is not healthy." Which when combined can allow more effective decision-making rather than blind-guessing (note that the decision-making part and choosing the salad over the hamburger is NOT deductive reasoning here, the underlying conclusions are).

Deduction is important in everyday-life as well as scientific and mathematical thinking. However, it is not infallible, and must be used cautiously, as it is only as strong as its underlying premises. For instance, green food and salads are NOT inherently always 100% healthy -- a moldy green meat covered in poisoned tomatoes would be a counter-argument. It is more dangerous when applied to larger biases, such as those that we make of genders and races or the like as it is dificult to separate facts mixed with exceptions and stereotypes/opinions. A healthy *skepticism* is needed in applying deduction, allowing you to presume a general conclusion but also allow for exceptions and counters to the premises of your conclusion.

The problem is not deductive reasoning itself, as logically if the premises hold true then the conclusions hold true, and deductive reasoning is about as certain as you can obtain knowledge in logical thinking (assuming, of course, our concepts of logical processes hold true and we do not delve into deeper and more abstract epistemological issue). It's how we generate premises, via inductive reasoning. You may think salads are healthy as eating them has made you feel good, kept you alive, is said to be good from various sources, etc. Each source of knowledge that you used to generate your premise that "salads are healthy" could be wrong, or the issue could be more nuanced than the premise suggests (i.e. "Vitamin X typically found in X food typically found in salads, when prepared correctly as it typically is in most human establishments, shows to generally help humans in growth/survival").

We almost *must* make assumptions at some level in order to function with any semblance of what we currently call living, and even our axioms of "a is a" and underlying faith in logical/mathematical/scientific thinking are at their core blind, dogmatic, and "self-serving" beliefs. You'd likely be correct in assuming the sun will rise tomorrow based on your past experience and sources supporting the premise that "the sun rises each morning" and applying it using deduction such that "tomorrow morning is a morning, the sun rises each morning, thus the sun will rise tomorrow morning", even if the actuality is more nuanced ("the sun does not rise, but rather appears to rise based on our changing position relative to the sun") or entirely false ("a fast massive object snuffed the sun out a few minutes ago or stopped earth's orbit thus the premise that the sun will rise each morning is false based on the current definitions of 'morning' and such"). Yet we also arguably should hold a healthy skepticism for our premises -- treat your conclusions and premises alike as a probability, not a certainty, as deductive reasoning only implies certainty if the premise is certain.
