# Critical Thinking

> The objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgment.

There's not much more to it. Simply, it is knowing how to use information to connect and form relationships in order to deduce further information. It does *not* relate to being able to store or know a lot of things, but rather knowing how to obtain more information and apply it, an important distinction. While it often behooves someone to be both knowledgeable and a critical thinker, i.e. how to apply said knowledge, these two do not necessarily follow. As such, it is more important to learn critical thinking and the methods in which one solves problems over memorizing rote cases due to the ever-changing knowledge-scape.
